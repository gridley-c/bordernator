# bordernator
Uses PILLOW to apply a border to photos in a directory. 

The border and text label automatically scale with image size. 

For cinematic aspect ratios it will add cinema bars instead of a border.  

Bordernator will also create and apply a text label using IPTC metadata tags.

Requires GLOB, PILLOW and iptcinfo3.
